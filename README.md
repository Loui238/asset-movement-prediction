# asset-movement-prediction

This project consists in predicting the movement of some crypto currencies (BTC,ETH,BNB) one step ahead. Different algorithms are tried (Logistic regression, Random forest and Support Vector machines). 

You can use the file collect_data.ipynb to gather crypto price data directly from binance. It also allows you to define any kind of timeframe.
